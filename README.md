# Projectify tool

## Intro

> **Designs provided by Digiti.be**

Given a Figma design I converted the design in a (semi) responsive front-end layout with future integrations in mind. Since the designs heavily indicated the project being an application I chose for the React library. React allows us to quickly create a proof of concept from design and easily allows us to expand the application later by adding `react-router-dom` and/or state management libraries.

## Starting the project

### üñ• Running the application

`git clone https://github.com/NielsPeeters/projectify-tool.git`
`cd projectify-tool`

`yarn start` runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### üß™ Testing

> ‚ö†Ô∏è No tests written yet

`yarn test` launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### üõ† Building

`yarn build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
